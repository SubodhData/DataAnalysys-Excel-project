Project Objective:-
This project analyzes Atliq Hardware’s sales data (2020–2021) to generate actionable business insights using Microsoft Excel and Power Query (ETL process).

The objective was to transform raw sales data into structured reports that answer key business questions related to product performance, division growth, and country-level sales trends.

All data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and reporting were performed using Excel Power Query and advanced Excel analytics techniques.

ETL Process (Power Query)
